    "1. Get up-and-running with Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "2. Obey best practices such as commenting, documenting and sharing results in reproducable and effective ways\n",
    "3. Start to think in an \"algorithmic\" way, i.e. think about how you can resort to computational resources in order to perform repetitive tasks\n",
    "4. Understand how you can deploy a diverse arsenal of (mostly free and complementary) tools and services and subsequently develop your own toolkit and work-flow based on preferences and experiences\n",
    "5. Get used to machine-readable formats and objects\n",
    "6. Learn how to seek help in the extensive open-source community and contribute to it, if you believe you can\n",
